        <p>My journey as an artist has been a path filled with many different mediums led by long chapters of reflection. Since I was young I would contemplate personal experiences to form tangible expressions. Working on projects for me is a form of self reflection and growth. I was enthralled with the freedom of poetry,  the systems in ceramics, the vulnerability  of visual journals, and the playfulness of costuming. The most captivating medium I have worked with are Liquid Light Shows, here is the story of how I came across this wonderful piece of my life. </p>
        
        <p>In high school while perusing the internet I came across a Tumblr page called Liquid Light Lab. It was a page Curated by a light show operator, Steve Pavlovsky, dedicated to the history of psychedelic light shows,pioneering artists, techniques, vintage media, theories, and related artistic movements. I studied every corner of that website and found a treasure trove of information, from step by step videos on how to create light shows to recorded interviews with artists. I had arrived at my favorite place on the internet that day, the next step was to put this new interest of mine into practice.</p>
        
        <p>I needed a projector, some curved glass, mineral oil, and two kinds of dyes. I knew who could help. I would call the first creative I ever met, my grandma. She took me to a clock maker's shop in town where we purchased two pieces of clock glass. The next item to find was an overhead projector. I figured my friend, the school librarian, might know how to find one. Turns out there was a graveyard of about 20 projectors stored in a room in the back of the library. Jackpot! I gathered the rest of the items from an arts and craft store. Now I had what I needed to start messing around with light shows.</p>
       
        <p>The aspect to light shows that really sparked my interest was that they shared a symbiotic relationship to music. I've always interacted with live music by dancing and I associate music with movement. A light show is essentially a fleeting moving moment made up of undulating/ abstract patterns projected onto a wall. These shows are like every other moment in life; you will never live the same second over. Every second is unique.</p>
        
        <p>The summer I graduated from High School I traveled through the eastern states of America and worked on food trucks at different music and arts festivals. There I experienced a variety of whimsical environments that groups of passionate artists brought to life for anyone who found themselves curious. Witnessing people create dreamscapes that they conjured up from their imagination taught me an invaluable lesson. Create a space you want to live in and share what you have learned with anyone who might be interested. The places I had the privilege of traveling to inspired me to continue practicing light shows and ultimately make my dreams a reality. </p>
